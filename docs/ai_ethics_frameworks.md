# AI Ethics Frameworks - Explanations and Resources

This document provides more detailed explanations of the ethics frameworks used in the AI Ethics Poll Game. You can use this information to enhance the presenter's discussion of results and provide more context for participants.

## 1. Utilitarianism

### Core Principle
Seeks the greatest happiness or benefit for the greatest number of people.

### Application to AI Ethics
Utilitarians evaluate AI systems based on their overall impact and outcomes. They typically support AI implementations that:
- Maximize efficiency and productivity
- Provide the greatest benefit to the most people
- Reduce harm across the population as a whole

### Key Questions
- Does this AI system create more benefit than harm in total?
- How are benefits and harms distributed across society?
- Could resources be allocated differently for greater overall utility?

### Notable Advocates
- Peter Singer (contemporary philosopher)
- Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill (historical)

## 2. Deontology (Duty-Based Ethics)

### Core Principle
Focuses on following moral rules and duties regardless of consequences.

### Application to AI Ethics
Deontologists evaluate AI systems based on whether they respect universal moral duties. They typically emphasize:
- Respect for human autonomy and dignity
- Universal rules that should never be broken
- Treating humans as ends in themselves, not means to an end

### Key Questions
- Does this AI system respect people's rights and dignity?
- Does it treat users as autonomous beings capable of making their own choices?
- Does it follow universal moral principles regardless of outcomes?

### Notable Advocates
- Immanuel Kant (historical)
- Christine Korsgaard (contemporary philosopher)

## 3. Virtue Ethics

### Core Principle
Focuses on developing virtuous character and making decisions that reflect moral excellence.

### Application to AI Ethics
Virtue ethicists evaluate AI systems based on whether they embody and promote virtuous traits. They typically emphasize:
- AI systems that encourage human flourishing
- Technologies that help people develop virtuous character
- Design that reflects moral excellence and wisdom

### Key Questions
- Does this AI system help people flourish and develop virtuous character?
- Would a person with practical wisdom design AI this way?
- What virtues or vices does this technology embody or encourage?

### Notable Advocates
- Aristotle (historical)
- Shannon Vallor (contemporary tech ethicist)

## 4. Rights-Based Ethics

### Core Principle
Focuses on protecting fundamental human rights and liberties.

### Application to AI Ethics
Rights-based ethicists evaluate AI systems based on whether they respect and protect human rights. They typically emphasize:
- Protection of privacy, free expression, and due process
- Equal rights regardless of background or status
- Non-violation of fundamental liberties

### Key Questions
- Does this AI system respect human rights like privacy and free expression?
- Are rights distributed equally regardless of who uses the system?
- Could this technology enable rights violations?

### Notable Advocates
- John Locke (historical)
- Martha Nussbaum (contemporary philosopher)

## 5. Justice-Oriented Ethics

### Core Principle
Focuses on fair distribution of benefits, harms, opportunities, and risks.

### Application to AI Ethics
Justice-oriented ethicists evaluate AI systems based on how fairly they distribute benefits and harms. They typically emphasize:
- Equitable access to AI benefits
- Fair distribution of risks and potential harms
- Special attention to historically marginalized communities

### Key Questions
- How are the benefits and risks of this AI system distributed?
- Does it perpetuate or address existing inequalities?
- Do all stakeholders have a fair say in how the system is designed and implemented?

### Notable Advocates
- John Rawls (historical)
- Ruha Benjamin (contemporary tech ethicist)

## 6. Care Ethics

### Core Principle
Prioritizes relationships, care, and interdependence over abstract principles.

### Application to AI Ethics
Care ethicists evaluate AI systems based on how they affect relationships and vulnerable individuals. They typically emphasize:
- Protection of vulnerable populations
- Strengthening of human relationships
- Contextual and situational moral judgments

### Key Questions
- How does this AI system affect those who are most vulnerable?
- Does it support or undermine human relationships and communities?
- Does it show appropriate care for those affected by its decisions?

### Notable Advocates
- Nel Noddings (historical and contemporary)
- Virginia Held (contemporary philosopher)
